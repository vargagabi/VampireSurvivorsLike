Issues:
	-Skeletons don't reach player from above, decrease stop distance
	-No icon for direction pointer

Fixed:
	-Maximum healt not updating when selecting reward to increase max health.
	-Health bar jumps to zero if less than about 25%
	-Crashing: Pressing esc when selecting reward multiple times crashes the game, and shows the pause screen
	-Enemy spins fast when on player
	-Fix aura is over the player, and the rectangle shows
	-Refactor player Attribute to a standalone class

New Feature:
	-New Weapon: Aura
	-New Monster: Skeleton
	-Damage indicator on mobs and player

Future plans/ideas:
	-Create Boss monster
	-Music, Sounds
	-Fix menu, add settings, save progress, etc...
	-Night time
	-Item that disables tree collision?
