Found:
	-Enemy spins fast when on player
	-Crashing: Pressing esc when selecting reward multiple times crashes the game, and shows the pause screen

Fixed:
	-Maximum healt not updating when selecting reward to increase max health.
			-Maximum healt: used Value instead of GetValue, value returned initial value.
	-Health bar jumps to zero if less than about 25%
			-Health bar: the backround color was the same as when the health is below 25%.

New Feature:
